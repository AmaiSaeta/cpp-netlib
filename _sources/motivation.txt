Motivation
==========

We're a group of C++ developers and we kept becoming annoyed that we
had to repeatedly write the same code when building applications that
needed to be network-aware.

We found that there was a lack of accessible networking libraries,
either standard or open source, that fulfilled our needs.  Such
libraries exist for every other major language.  So, building on top
of `Boost.Asio`_, we decided to get together and build our own.
