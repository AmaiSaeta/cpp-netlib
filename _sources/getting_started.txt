 Getting started
*****************

Downloading an official release
===============================

All stable versions of :mod:`cpp-netlib` can be downloaded from Github:
http://github.com/cpp-netlib/cpp-netlib/downloads.  Each release
is available as gzipped (Using the command ``tar xzf
cpp-netlib.tar.gz``) or bzipped (Using ``tar xjf cpp-netlib.tar.bz2``)
tarball, or as a zipfile (``unzip cpp-netlib.zip``, or on Windows
using a tool such as 7zip_).

.. _7zip: http://www.7-zip.org/

Downloading a development version
=================================

The :mod:`cpp-netlib` uses Git_ for source control, so to use any
development versions Git must be installed on your system.

Using the command line, the command to get the latest code is:

::

    shell$ git clone git://github.com/mikhailberis/cpp-netlib.git

This should be enough information get to started.  To do more complex
things with Git, such as pulling changes or checking out a new branch,
refer to the `Git documentation`_.

Windows users need to use msysGit_, and to invoke the command above
from a shell.

For fans of Subversion_, the same code can be checked out from
http://svn.github.com/mikhailberis/cpp-netlib.git.

Getting Boost
=============

:mod:`cpp-netlib` depends on Boost_.  It should work for any version
of Boost above 1.41.0.  If Boost is not installed on your system, the
latest package can be found on the `Boost web-site`_.  The environment
variable ``BOOST_ROOT`` must be defined, which must be the full path
name of the top directory of the Boost distribution.  Although Boost
is mostly header only, applications built using :mod:`cpp-netlib`
still requires linking with `Boost.System`_.

.. _Boost: http://www.boost.org/doc/libs/release/more/getting_started/index.html
.. _`Boost web-site`: http://www.boost.org/users/download/
.. _`Boost.System`: http://www.boost.org/libs/system/index.html

Getting CMake
=============

The :mod:`cpp-netlib` uses CMake_.

.. _CMake: http://www.cmake.org/

Open a command line in the :mod:`cpp-netlib` home directory.
``cmake`` requires the code to be built out of source, so you need to
create a separate directory.

Instructions for Windows Users
==============================



Instructions for Linux Users
============================

Invoke ``cmake`` in the build directory, this generates a Makefile.
Then, invoke ``make`` to build everything (unit tests and examples).
To run the tests, invoke ``make test``.

::

    shell$ make
    shell$ make test

Running the Unit Tests
======================

All unit tests are located in the ``libs/network/test`` directory.  To
run the full suite of unit tests, invoke ``ctest`` from the build
directory.

Building and Running the Examples
=================================

Examples are located in the ``libs/network/examples`` subdirectory.
